# circle-prog
A program that will calculate circumference, area and many more of a circle.

1. You have to choose whether you wanted to use radian or diameter to start calculating.
2. The result will come out with the circumference, area of a circle.
3. Next, the program will ask for an input for the degree to start calculating for area of sector and
   area of segment.
4. Finally, after all calculation is done, it will start using turtle to start drawing a circle based on your radian/
   diameter.

#note
- still have to do an option whether the user wanted to use the program again or exit the program.
- need to reuse the codes and making sure turtle won't cause trouble.
